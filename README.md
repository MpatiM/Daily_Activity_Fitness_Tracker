# Daily_Activity_Fitness_Tracker

### About
The objective of this project is as follows:
* Utilize advanced python tools and libraries (Numpy, Panda, Matplotlib, Scipy) to analyze Activity data.
  * Data download, cleaning, and preparation.
  * Join multiple dataset tables
  * Add new columns to merged dataset
  * Run statistical analysis tests
* Generate various analytical reports to show: 
  * List Daily Summary data
  * List average Calories, Step Total, Activity Minutes, and Activity Distance by Id
  * Display Statistics of the Total criteria columns in Activity dataset
  * List the Correlation between Step Total and Calories by Id
  * Perform Linear Regression to analyze if Calories is impacted by Total Active Distance and Total Active Minutes
  * Run a t-test to see if the mean of Step Total is equal to the recommended step total 10,000
* Generate data visualization charts for the above reports. 

Generated reports and charts for analysis as shown below:
* Reported Daily Summary data making it easier to view at a glance the necessary data for the individuals daily report, all related to the days activity total.
* Reported and analyzed individuals overall average activity intensity breakdown.
* Reported the overall statistics of the individuals daily total data. This allowed me to see who was the most active, who was the least active, what their max/min calorie expenditure was and overall average.
* Reported the correlation values for each individual, showing who had the highest correlation between total steps and calories. Displayed graph charts and line charts to analyze visually the individualâ€™s with the highest/lowest correlation between total steps and calories.
* Performed Linear Regression to analyze if Calories is impacted by Total Active Distance and Total Active Minutes.
* Performed statistical testing, One sample t-test, on if the mean of Step Total is equal to the recommended step total 10,000.
